3.  Java Projects:
       -   [Java Spring Boot Todo API ](learning/projects/toDoApi/README.md) - A simple todo API using Spring Boot. Build the app with `mvn clean package` and run the application using `mvn spring-boot:run` - open on  `http://localhost:8082/` to view the minimal interface for it or `http://localhost:8082/api/todos` for the naked api.
